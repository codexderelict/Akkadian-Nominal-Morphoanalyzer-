The first real version of the Akkadian Nominal Morphoanalyzer is finally here! :D 
Having finished CS50P and being introduced to the power of OOP, modularity and regular expressions, I finally developed a version I feel proud of. Goodbye string ops, hello regex! 
This is my CS50P final project, though I don't plan on submitting it and I never submitted anything on edX, choosing instead to do the problems myself. 
Perhaps the greatest difficulty I faced was learning the ropes of regular expressions. Building the knowledge was hard enough, building the confidence to put out a project like this even harder.
In fact, in the beginning, I thought that this project was a crapshoot and well beyond my limits at that point. Just days later, I got this working and I'm very happy with it. 

REQUIREMENTS:
Python 3.13 
FreeSimpleGUI
Cursory knowledge of Akkadian noun morphology

HOW TO USE:
Run main.py and you'll be greeted with the frontend GUI. Input one single Akkadian noun (in status rectus/governed state) and click "Analyze". Below the input prompt, you'll find the gender, number and case. Simple!

WHAT'S NEW:
A GUI with FreeSimpleGUI for ease of use
More robust grammatical analysis using regular expressions
Modular design (three separate files for regex patterns, engine and GUI!)
Dictionary/list comprehension and OOP based approach as opposed to if-else blocks

POSSIBLE FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
Addition of grammatical state analysis (rectus, absolutus, constructus)
Nicer GUI with a fun little image added to the top 
Complex FST/transitional/state-machine based approach 
Probabilistic parsing for edge case handling 
Addition of regexes for verbs, adjectives and root-stem extractions

THANKS:
My 12th grade statistics teacher, Ms. F, for teaching me that I can think mathematically and solve formal problems in math, logic, language and programming alike. 
My friends (all of them!) for keeping my spirits high when I felt incapable of moving forward, in life, or in programming
Old Web 1.0 sites (Omniglot, Ancient Hebrew Research Center and others) for making me fall in love with historical linguistics as a child
My parents for having subsidized me and keeping me alive long enough to start this project in the first place
David Malan and the folks over at Harvard responsible for CS50, the courses that turned me from a coder into a programmer 
God, for having given me the enthusiasm and love for systems, structures and models, be they linguistic, logical, mathematical or computational
