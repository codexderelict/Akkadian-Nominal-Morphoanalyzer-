Well, hello! This is V1.1 of the Akkadian Noun Morphoanalyzer. Or the Akkadian Nominal Morphoanalyzer. Whichever one suits you best. ANM for short. A new addition: states!  Well, almost, there's two. Status rectus (lemma form of Akkadian nouns), and then status constructus/absolutus, which can't be disambiguated without involving syntax, which is outside the scope of this project (regular expressions aren't exactly the best for nouns). I'd need to make a tokenizer or invite NLTK but I don't want to require another library to use this, I'd like to keep it skinny with just a GUI library and everything else already packaged with Python. 

In the future, I may make an analyzer for verbs. It'll be a challenge with Semitic morphology, but it'll be fun. With respect to Semitic languages, Akkadian has a rather skinny grammar. I chose it precisely because it's not that difficult to build an analyzer for. I may work with Sumerian, as well, which is more of a challenge with 10 cases (Akkadian has 3), animacy and inanimacy, and reduplication (which, to my knowledge, regular languages are not suited for). Python's .split() could work for those, I suppose. We'll see how that turns out!
